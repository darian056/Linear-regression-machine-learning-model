This project demonstrates a simple implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent in Python. The model predicts a student's score based on the number of hours studied.

Files Included
main.py – Python script that runs the linear regression algorithm

data.csv – Contains sampled data of hours studied and corresponding scores

README.md – Project overview and instructions

Dataset
The dataset contains two columns:

Number of hours studied

Corresponding score

How It Works
Loads data from data.csv

Applies gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error

Plots the best-fit regression line against the data points using matplotlib

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:


pip install matplotlib numpy
Ensure data.csv is in the same directory as main.py

Run the script:
python main.py
